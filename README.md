# Project Name

## Description

This project involves retrieving real-time data from a remote API, storing it in a database, creating an API to access the latest records, and
developing a frontend application to visualize this data in a tabular format.

## Key Components

Data Fetching: Data is fetched from a remote API that provides real-time information.
Database Storage: Fetched data is stored in a database for persistent storage and retrieval.
API Creation: An API endpoint is implemented to fetch the latest records stored in the database.
Frontend Application: A frontend application is built to display the retrieved data in a user-friendly tabular format.




## Usage

Installation: Detailed instructions for setting up both the backend and frontend components can be found in their respective README files (Backend README and Frontend README).

Deployment: Guidelines on deploying the application, including considerations for hosting the backend API and frontend application.



## Technology Used

Backend: Express.js, MongoDB (via Mongoose), node-fetch for API requests.
Frontend: React.js, Vite for build optimization, fetch for HTTP requests.
